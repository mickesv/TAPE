DONE 2013-01-17: Fix bug in model/csvread when comment-field contains double equal signs, e.g. "operator==". This gets split and interpreted in the wrong way.

DONE 2013-01-18: Find C++ Classes
DONE 2013-01-18: Find C++ Methods
DONE 2013-01-18: Find C++ Attributes
DONE 2013-01-18: Parse C++ Methods

Inheritance should create a node as well. ... or at least an attribute

DONE 2013-01-25: Fix lookup so that C++ methods are found when looking for a method call.
    One way to do this would be to create a new parser: CPlusPlusFunctionCallParser, that keeps track of variable declarations to keep track of the ones that are of "my" classes (and their types). Recurse into clang_callExpr, and a DeclRefExpr will show up to this variable, and then I can look up its type and find the right call.
    NOT NECESSARY: clang_getCursorSemanticParent(clang_getCursorReferenced(theCursor))) marks the spot.

Make sure that all hh-files are parsed first, to avoid the situation where class names are not found. Alternatively, run through the extraction phase twice to make sure that whatever is missed the first time gets caught the next time.
